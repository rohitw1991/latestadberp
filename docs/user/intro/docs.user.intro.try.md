There are many ways to get started with ERPNext.

### 1. See the Demo

If you want to check out the user interface and **feel** the application, just see the demo at:

- [https://demo.erpnext.com](https://demo.erpnext.com)

### 2. Get a Free 30 day Trial at ERPNext.com

If you like the feel and want to set it up for your own company, you can take a 30 day free trial (no credit card details required) at ERPNext.com

ERPNext.com is managed by the organization (Web Notes) that publishes ERPNext. You can do a trial run with your own account by [signing up on the website](https://erpnext.com/pricing-and-signup).

You can also decide to host your application at ERPNext.com by buying the hosting plans. This way you support the organization that develops and improves ERPNext. You also get one-to-one functional (usage) support with the hosting plans.

### 3. Download a Virtual Machine

To avoid the trouble of installing an instance, ERPNext is available as a Virtual Image (a full loaded operating system with ERPNext installed). You can use this on **any** platform including Microsoft Windows.

[Click here to see instructions on how to use the Virtual Image](docs.download.html)

ERPNext is reasonably easy to install on a Unix like operating system and requires:

1. MySQL database
1. Apache Web Server
1. Python
1. Memcached

to be installed.
