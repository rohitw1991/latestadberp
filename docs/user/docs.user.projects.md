Managing Projects

ERPNext helps you manage your Projects by breaking them into Tasks and allocating them to different people. 

Purchasing and selling can also be tracked against Projects and this can help the company keep tabs on its budget, delivery and profitability for a Project. 

Projects can be used to manage internal projects, manufacturing jobs or service jobs. For service jobs, Time Sheets can also be created that can be used to bill Customers if billing is done on a Time & Money basis.

## Project

The Project record maintains the details of your project and milestones that you have set. The Project record can be linked in Quotations, Sales Orders, Delivery Notes, Sales Invoices, Purchase Requests, Purchase Orders and Purchase Invoices. This way you can keep a track of all the activities that happen around this project.

## Tasks

Project is broken into Tasks and each Task is allocated to a resource. In ERPNext, you can also create an allocate a Task independently of a Project. If you define the start and end dates, it will add calendar events for the same and also show the task on the Gantt Chart that you can use for monitoring the Project.

## Time Sheets

You can create Time Sheets to track billable work to Customers. These Time Sheets can be tracked against Project and Tasks so that you can get reports on how much time was spent on each Task or Project.
