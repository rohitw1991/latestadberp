An Attendance record stating that an Employee has been present on a particular day can be created either manually by:

> HR > Attendance > New Attendance
￼
Or if you are collecting attendance information via an automated system like a swipe card, then you can upload a CSV file with the attendance information. 

You can get a monthly report of your Attendance data by going to the “Monthly Attendance Details” report.

To upload the attendance go to:

> HR > Upload Attendance (sidebar)

### Leave Allotment

Fixed number of leaves per Employee can be allocated using the Leave Allocation Tool. If you have special leaves to be allocated, you can also allocate them manually by create new Leave Allocation records.

---

### Leave Application

If your company has a formal system where Employees have to apply for leaves and only if their leaves are approved they are considered as paid leaves, you can create Leave Application to track approval and usage of leaves. You have to mention the Employee, Leave Type and the period for which the leave is taken. If you want only certain users to approve leaves, you can give “Submission” rights to those users only.

If you want all users to create their own Leave Applications, you can set their “Employee ID” as a match rule in the Leave Application Permission settings. See the earlier discussion on permission settings for more info.
