### Email

You can email any transaction from the system by clicking on the “Email” button in the right sidebar. A log of all your sent emails will be maintained in Communication.

### Comments

Comments are a great way to add information about a transaction that is not a part of the transactions. Like some background information etc. Comments can be added in the right sidebar.

### Tags

Like Assignments and Comments, you can also add your own tags to each type of transactions. These tags can help you search a document and also classify it. ERPNext will also show you all the important tags in the document list.
