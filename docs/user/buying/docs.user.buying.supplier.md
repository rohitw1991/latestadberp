Suppliers are companies or individuals who provide you with products or services. They are treated in exactly the same manner as Customers in ERPNext.


You can create a new Supplier via:

> Buying > Supplier > New Supplier

### Contacts and Addresses

 Contacts and Addresses in ERPNext are stored separately so that you can attach multiple Contacts or Addresses to Customers and Suppliers. To add a Contact or Address go to Buying and click on “New Contact” or “New Address”.


> Tip: When you select a Supplier in any transaction, one Contact and Address gets pre-selected. This is the “Default Contact or Address”. So make sure you set your defaults correctly!




> Buying > Contact > New Contact
