1. Separate Account Ledgers are created for the Supplier in the Company under “Accounts Payable”.
1. You can have multiple Addresses and Contacts for Suppliers.
1. Suppliers are categorized as Supplier Type.
1. If you set “Credit Days”, ERPNext will automatically set the due date in Purchase Invoices.
